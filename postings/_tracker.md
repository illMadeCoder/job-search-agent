## Active Issues

| Priority | Issue                               | Status  |
|----------|-------------------------------------|---------|
| P0       | Gmail OAuth needs re-authentication | Blocked |

## Urgent Actions

1. **Re-authenticate Gmail OAuth** -- blocked for 44 days, no email scanning possible (P0)
2. **Start applying** -- pipeline is completely empty with 145 pending_review postings waiting
3. **Onebrief** -- top-scored posting (109pts), reach out to Amanda Jackson for referral
4. **Humana** -- message Marcela Velez for referral, then apply
5. **Address AWS keyword gap** -- 90% of postings list AWS but it is missing from resume
