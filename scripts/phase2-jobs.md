# Phase 2: Job Collection Agent

You are the main job search agent. Update existing postings and collect new opportunities.

**IMPORTANT**: You are running unattended at 5am. Do NOT ask questions.

---

## ⚠️ CONTEXT MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)

You have a 200k token limit. Large API responses WILL overflow your context and crash the run.

### Rules:
1. **NEVER use WebFetch for job board APIs** - they return 100k+ tokens
   - ❌ `WebFetch: https://remoteok.com/api` (returns entire job database)
   - ❌ `WebFetch: https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/company/jobs`
   - ✅ Use WebSearch instead: `site:boards.greenhouse.io company "platform engineer"`

2. **Process incrementally** - don't accumulate all jobs then filter
   - After each search, immediately filter and discard non-matches
   - Keep only: company, role, URL, salary, location (5 fields max per job)
   - Discard: full descriptions, requirements lists, company bios

3. **Limit per source** - max 10 jobs per search query
   - If a search returns 50 results, take top 10 by relevance
   - Better to miss some than crash the run

4. **Summarize, don't store** - for large responses:
   - Extract structured data immediately
   - Discard raw response
   - Never keep full job descriptions in working memory

### If you hit context limits:
- Stop current source, move to next
- Log which source caused overflow
- Complete remaining phases with partial data

---

## Input

Read state from:
- `/tmp/phase1-state.yaml` - Email scan results
- `config.yaml` - User preferences (roles, salary, scoring)
- `sources.yaml` - API patterns
- `postings/_schema.yaml` - Data format
- `jb_resume_2025.tex` - Resume for matching

## Output

Write state to: `/tmp/phase2-state.yaml`

---

## Pre-Phase: Check Beads

Before starting, check task queue:

```bash
bd ready --json
```

Process any due tasks that affect job collection (e.g., "skip fintech").

### Weekly: LinkedIn Archive Refresh

Check if 7+ days since last refresh:
```bash
bd ready --json | grep -i "linkedin refresh"
```

If due, add to state output: `linkedin_refresh_needed: true`

---

# Part A: Update Existing Postings

## A.1 Process Email Results

Read `/tmp/phase1-state.yaml` and process each classified email:

### Recruiter Outreach → Create Posting
```yaml
# Create posting folder
postings/{company-slug}.{role-slug}.pending_review.{timestamp}Z/

# posting.yaml
application:
  state: pending_review
  recommendation: respond
events:
  - type: recruiter_inbound
    date: {now}
    data:
      channel: email
      email_id: {id}
      message_snippet: {snippet}
```

### Interview Invite → Update Posting
- Match to existing posting by company
- Add `interview_scheduled` event
- Update state to `interviewing` if not already

### Offer → Update Posting
- Match to existing posting
- Update state to `offer`
- Rename folder to `.offer`
- Flag as URGENT

### Rejection → Update Posting
- Match to existing posting
- Update state to `rejected`
- Rename folder to `.rejected`
- Add `rejection` event

### Confirmation → Verify Posting
- Match to existing posting
- Add `application_confirmed` event

### Company Response → Update Posting
- Match to existing posting
- Add `response_received` event with sentiment

## A.2 Health Check Active Postings

For each non-terminal posting (not `.offer`, `.rejected`, `.expired`, `.withdrawn`):

1. **List active folders**:
   - `*.pending_review.*`
   - `*.applied.*`
   - `*.interviewing.*`

2. **Check posting URL**:
   - Use WebFetch
   - **IMPORTANT**: If fetch fails (403, 999, timeout), do NOT assume job is gone
   - Only flag as missing if 404 or "job not found" in response

3. **Search for new roles at company**:
   - WebSearch "{company} careers remote platform engineer OR SRE"
   - If found: add to `new_roles_found` in state

4. **Update folder timestamp** to today

## A.3 Check Expirations

For each `.applied` folder:

1. Read `application.applied_date`
2. If today >= applied_date + 30 days:
   - Rename to `.expired`
   - Set `application.state: expired`
   - Add `expired` event

---

# Part B: Collect New Postings

## B.0 RSS Feeds (Most Reliable)

**RSS feeds are the most reliable source - structured data, no bot detection, exact timestamps.**

Reference `sources.yaml → rss` for available feeds.

### WeWorkRemotely

Fetch category feeds with curl (safe - small payloads):

```bash
# Fetch programming jobs RSS
curl -s "https://weworkremotely.com/categories/remote-programming-jobs.rss"

# Fetch devops jobs RSS
curl -s "https://weworkremotely.com/categories/remote-devops-sysadmin-jobs.rss"

# Fetch product jobs RSS
curl -s "https://weworkremotely.com/categories/remote-product-jobs.rss"
```

Parse each `<item>`:
- **title**: Split on `: ` → company, role
- **link**: Job URL
- **pubDate**: RFC 822 timestamp (exact posting time)
- **region**: Location info
- **type**: Full-Time, Contract, etc.

Apply filters immediately after parsing each feed. Keep only jobs matching:
- Required keywords
- Not excluded keywords/roles
- Remote US-friendly

**Note**: WWR RSS bypasses the 403 that blocks WebFetch on their website.

---

## B.1 API Sources (Via WebSearch)

### RemoteOK
**DO NOT use WebFetch** - API returns 100k+ tokens and will crash.

Instead use WebSearch:
```
WebSearch: site:remoteok.com "platform engineer" OR "SRE" OR "devops" remote
```
Extract: company, role, URL, salary from search snippets.

### Greenhouse / Lever Discovery
**DO NOT use direct API calls** - responses too large.

Use search-based discovery (already configured in `config.yaml → sources.search`):
```
WebSearch: site:boards.greenhouse.io "platform engineer" remote
WebSearch: site:jobs.lever.co "SRE" remote
```
This finds ANY company using these ATS platforms, not just curated lists.

### HackerNews Who's Hiring
Use WebSearch to find current thread:
```
WebSearch: site:news.ycombinator.com "Ask HN: Who is hiring" January 2026
```
Then WebFetch the thread URL (single page, manageable size).
Parse for remote platform/SRE/devops roles. Limit to 10 best matches.

### Hiring Without Whiteboards (Weekly - Mondays Only)

**Only run on Mondays** - this curated list doesn't change frequently.

```bash
# Check day of week
if [ "$(date +%u)" -eq 1 ]; then
  # It's Monday - scan the list
fi
```

Fetch the raw markdown:
```
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards/main/README.md"
```

Parse entries matching pattern:
```
- [Company Name](careers_url) | Location | Interview description
```

**Filter for:**
- Location contains "Remote" (case-insensitive)
- Skip "Europe only", "UK only", "Canada only"

**For matching companies:**
1. Check if they use Greenhouse/Lever (prefer API)
2. Otherwise: `WebSearch: "{company}" platform engineer OR SRE remote`
3. Limit to 10 new companies per run

**Value:** These companies use practical interviews (take-homes, pair programming) not leetcode.

## B.2 Search Sources

Execute ALL enabled search sources from `config.yaml → sources.search`.
Track results by source for diversity reporting.

For each search source:
1. Run WebSearch with each query
2. Deduplicate results (same company+role = 1 posting)
3. Record: source name, jobs found, jobs qualified

```
Example: WebSearch: site:boards.greenhouse.io "platform engineer" remote
```

**Diversity Tracking**: Must have results from at least `config.sources.diversity.min_categories` categories.
If a category has 0 results, note it in the state output for troubleshooting.

## B.3 Skip Manual Sources

Do NOT attempt: LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Otta (login required).
Log: "Manual sources skipped"

## B.4 Apply Filters

**CRITICAL: Jobs failing ANY filter must be DISCARDED. Do NOT create folders.**

Read filters from `config.yaml`:
- `search.required_keywords` - At least one must match
- `search.exclude_keywords` - Disqualify if any match
- `search.exclude_roles` - Disqualify if role title CONTAINS any of these (case-insensitive substring match)
  - Example: "security engineer" in exclude_roles should disqualify "Staff Cloud Security Engineer"
- `search.one_per_company` - Keep only best match per company
- `location.remote_only` - Disqualify if not remote
- `location.countries` - Disqualify if not in list
- `salary.minimum` - Disqualify if salary.max < minimum (e.g., $98k max < $130k min = DISCARD)
  - Exception: If salary is undisclosed AND `include_undisclosed: true`, allow through
- `salary.maximum` - Disqualify if salary.min > maximum (role expects too much expertise)
  - Example: Role pays $200k-$300k, your max is $200k → salary.min ($200k) > max ($200k) = DISCARD
  - This filters out Staff/Principal roles where even the floor exceeds your ceiling
- `experience.*` - Disqualify if outside range
- `companies.blacklist` - Always disqualify

### Level Filtering (IMPORTANT)
- `experience.exclude_levels` - Disqualify if role level matches ANY of these
- Check role title for level indicators:
  - "Staff Engineer" → level = Staff → DISCARD if Staff in exclude_levels
  - "Principal Engineer" → level = Principal → DISCARD
  - "Senior Staff" → level = Staff → DISCARD
  - "Distinguished Engineer" → level = Distinguished → DISCARD
- This is CASE-INSENSITIVE substring matching on role title
- Log discarded: "Level filtered: {role} contains '{level}' which is in exclude_levels"

### One Per Company
If `config.search.one_per_company` is true:
1. Group jobs by company
2. Calculate match_rate for each
3. Keep ONLY highest match
4. Log discarded: "Lower match than {kept_role} ({match}% vs {kept}%)"

## B.5 Check LinkedIn Data

### Find Referrals
```bash
python3 scripts/linkedin-tools.py connections --company "{company}" --json
```

If found:
- Set `recommendation: referral`
- Populate `referral_candidates`

### Check Past Applications
```bash
python3 scripts/linkedin-tools.py past-applications
```

## B.6 Analyze Resume Match

For each job:
1. Extract keywords from posting
2. Normalize (lowercase, canonical names)
3. Compare against resume
4. Calculate: `match.matched / match.total * 100`

## B.7 Create Posting Folders

### Deduplication Check (REQUIRED)
Before creating ANY posting folder, check if it already exists:

```bash
ls postings/ | grep -i "^{company-slug}\.{role-slug}\."
```

**If a folder exists for this company+role:**
- Do NOT create a new folder (this causes duplicates)
- Skip to next job
- Log: "Skipped duplicate: {company} {role} already exists"

**Only create if no existing folder matches.**

### Folder Naming
For qualifying jobs that pass deduplication:

```
postings/{company-slug}.{role-slug}.pending_review.{YYYY-MM-DDTHHMM}Z/
```

- `company-slug`: lowercase, hyphens for spaces (e.g., "red-hat", "included-health")
- `role-slug`: lowercase, hyphens for spaces, remove special chars
- Timestamp: UTC time of creation

Create `posting.yaml` with all required fields per schema.

## B.8 Gather Company Intel

For NEW postings with `recommendation: cold_apply` or `referral`:

1. Find engineering blog: WebSearch "{company} engineering blog"
2. Find GitHub org: WebSearch "{company} github"
3. Find recent news: WebSearch "{company} funding announcement"

Extract relevant posts, repos, tech stack. Write to `company_intel` section.

**Time-box**: Max 2 minutes per company.

## B.9 Generate Application Materials

For NEW postings with `recommendation: cold_apply` or `referral`:

### Resume Tailoring
Generate `resume_tailoring` section:
- Keywords to emphasize
- Keywords to add
- Bullet suggestions
- Summary suggestion

### Cover Letter
Generate `cover_letter` section:
- Personalized content referencing company intel
- Experience alignment
- Under 350 words

## B.10 Generate Interview Prep

For `.interviewing` postings without `interview_prep.generated`:

Generate comprehensive prep:
- Company overview
- Role focus (requirements, strengths, gaps)
- Expected questions with answer outlines
- Questions to ask
- Talking points

---

## B.11 Update Priority Queue

Maintain `postings/_priority_queue.yaml` for the daily digest.

### Read Current Queue

```bash
cat postings/_priority_queue.yaml
```

### Add New Jobs to Queue

For each NEW posting created in this run:

```yaml
- folder: {folder_name}
  score: {calculated}
  added: {today}
  last_shown: null
  times_shown: 0
  factors:
    match_rate: {from posting.yaml}
    freshness: 15  # New job bonus
    salary: {10 if salary.max >= 155000 else 0}
    referral: {20 if has referral else 0}
    ny_location: {15 if NY else 0}
```

### Recalculate All Scores

For ALL jobs in queue (including existing):

```yaml
score = match_rate
      + referral_bonus (20 if has connection)
      + salary_bonus (10 if max >= target $155k)
      + ny_bonus (15 if NY location)
      + freshness_bonus:
          - 15 if added today
          - 10 if added 1-2 days ago
          - 5 if added 3-6 days ago
          - 0 if added 7+ days ago
      - staleness_penalty: 2 * (days_in_queue - 3) if > 3 days
      - shown_penalty: 5 * (times_shown - 2) if shown > 2 times
```

### Apply Queue Rules

1. **Demote stale jobs**: If `days_in_queue > 5` AND `times_shown >= 3` → move to backlog
2. **Remove applied/rejected**: If posting state changed → remove from queue
3. **Re-rank**: Sort queue by score descending

### Update Top 10

Take highest 10 scores from queue:

```yaml
top_10:
  - folder: ...
    score: 92
    rank: 1
    days_in_queue: 0
    times_shown: 0
    reason: "92% match, has referral, NY based"
  - folder: ...
    score: 87
    rank: 2
    ...
```

### Write Updated Queue

Write back to `postings/_priority_queue.yaml` with `updated: {now}`.
